  description: >
    Atomic swaps allow for on-chain trades between yerbas and yerbas assets, or between two different yerbas
    assets. This provides all the needed functionality to make Buy, Sell, and Trade orders that others may execute at
    will. In addition, these partial orders can be specially signed such that they are easily shared and completable
    by another party, allowing for clean 2-step orders where that can be shared through any number of side-channels.

    Squawker is an uncensorable way to communicate with the world. By using asset transfers 
    to denote the meaning of IPFS filehashes, anyone can say what they want. Through the 
    power of decentralized mining and proof of work your message will be accepted onto the 
    blockchain. As long as your IPFS filehash is pinned anyone with accesss to the 
    blockchain and an ipfs gateway (both are self hostable) can consume that content.
